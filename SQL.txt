Conditionals

CASE WHEN        | Allows conditional logic to be applied in SELECT statement
COALESCE()       | Returns first non null value in a list
NULLIF()         | Compares two expressions and returns null if equal, otherwise returns first expression
IF()             | Returns one value if a condition is TRUE or another value if condition is FALSE

Joins

Inner Join     | Selects rows from both tables that share a common field and values
Left Join      | Returns all rows from the left table along with matching rows from the right table; Nulls are returned if no match for right table columns
Right Join     | Returns all rows from the right table along with matching rows from the left table; Nulls are returned if no match for left table columns
Full Join      | Returns all rows from left and right tables; Nulls returned for no matching values
Cross Join     | Cartesian product of two tables where each row from the first table is paried with every row from the second 
Self Join      | Regular inner join where table is joined with itself with aliases; Useful for comparing rows within the same table
                        SELECT columns
                        FROM table AS alias1
                        JOIN table AS alias2 
                        ON alias1.column = alias2.related_column;
                
Subqquery

Allows complex filtering, aggregation, and data manipulation by using the result of one query inside another
Clauses that can be used with subqueries are:
    WHERE: filter rows based on subquery results.
    FROM: treat subquery as a temporary (derived) table.
    HAVING: filter aggregated results after grouping.




ENUM (enumeration) -- Data type used in MySQL and PostgreSQL used to define a column that can only hold a specific, predefined set of string values
