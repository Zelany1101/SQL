Conditionals

CASE WHEN        | Allows conditional logic to be applied in SELECT statement
COALESCE()       | Returns first non null value in a list
NULLIF()         | Compares two expressions and returns null if equal, otherwise returns first expression
IF()             | Returns one value if a condition is TRUE or another value if condition is FALSE

Joins

Inner Join     | Selects rows from both tables that share a common field and values
Left Join      | Returns all rows from the left table along with matching rows from the right table; Nulls are returned if no match for right table columns
Right Join     | Returns all rows from the right table along with matching rows from the left table; Nulls are returned if no match for left table columns
Full Join      | Returns all rows from left and right tables; Nulls returned for no matching values
Cross Join     | Cartesian product of two tables where each row from the first table is paried with every row from the second 
Self Join      | Regular inner join where table is joined with itself with aliases; Useful for comparing rows within the same table

Subqquery

Allows complex filtering, aggregation, and data manipulation by using the result of one query inside another
Clauses that can be used with subqueries are:
    WHERE: filter rows based on subquery results.
    FROM: treat subquery as a temporary (derived) table.
    HAVING: filter aggregated results after grouping.


ENUM (enumeration) -- Data type used in MySQL and PostgreSQL used to define a column that can only hold a specific, predefined set of string values

Common Table Expression (CTE)

Temporary, named result set defined within execution scope of a single SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, or DELETE statement
    * Acts as a temporary view that exists only during the query
    * Enables recursive operations for hierarchical data -- References itself and executes until the full hierarchy is returned
            * Anchor member -- Initial query that selects the base case
            * Recursive member -- Query that references the CTE itself, pullling the next level of data

                        Can be referenced multiple times  |   Typically used once.

Stored Procedure

Precompiled SQL statements stored in the database to perform a specific task
    * Can be executed as a single unit
    * Allow encapsulation of SQL code and business logic
    * Upon execution, accepts input parameters and return output 
    * Invoked by users, applications, or other procedures
    * Example
            * Automate database tasks
            * Improve efficiency
            * Reduce redundancy

Types of Stored Procedures
    * System Stored Procedures -- Predefined store procedures by SQL server for administrative tasks such as system configuration or database management
            * Example -- sp_help , sp_rename
    * User-Defined Stored Procedures -- Custom stored procedures created by users often to perform specific operations tailored to business's needs
            * Example -- Calculating totals, processing orders, generating reports
    * Extended Stored Procedures -- Execution of external functions, including those in other languages; Bridge betweeen SQL server and 3rd party applications / tools
    * CLR Stored Procedures -- Written in .NET language and executed within SQL server; Userful for when advanced functionality is needed that is not achieveable with SQL 

Triggers

Special stored procedure that automatically executes when specific events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) occur on a table
    * Automates tasks, maintain data consistency, record database activities
    * Tied to a specific table, running without manual execution
                  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Types of Triggers
    * DDL Triggers -- Data Definition Language command events (e.g Create_view, Drop_table, Drop_view, Alter_table)
            * Track changes in the structure of the database preventing any unauthorized table creation, alteration, or deletion
    * DML Triggers -- Detects commands that manipulate data like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
            * Scenario where data validation is needed before any insertion, log changes to a table, or cascade updates across related tables
    * Logon Triggers -- Respond to user logon events; Monitor login activity, restrict access, or limit active sessions for a login
            * Does not handle authentication errors

LAG() Function -- Windows function used to access data from a previous row in the same result set without using a self join
    * Used to compare current row's values to a prior one
            * Tracking changes in sales over time
            * Calculating time difference between events

                    LAG(expression, offset, default_value) OVER (PARTITION By partition_column ORDER BY order_column)
                            - epression -- column
                            - offset -- how many rows back
                            - default_value -- provides a value if no previous row exists
                            - OVER -- defines the winndow
                            - PARTITION BY -- devides data
                            _ ORDER BY -- required to define the row sequence
    * Example
            * LAG(temperature, 1) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS PreviousTemperature
            * LAG(recordDate, 1) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS PreviousRecordDate
