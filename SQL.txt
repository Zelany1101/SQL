Conditionals

CASE WHEN        | Allows conditional logic to be applied in SELECT statement
COALESCE()       | Returns first non null value in a list
NULLIF()         | Compares two expressions and returns null if equal, otherwise returns first expression
IF()             | Returns one value if a condition is TRUE or another value if condition is FALSE

Joins

Inner Join     | Selects rows from both tables that share a common field and values
Left Join      | Returns all rows from the left table along with matching rows from the right table; Nulls are returned if no match for right table columns
Right Join     | Returns all rows from the right table along with matching rows from the left table; Nulls are returned if no match for left table columns
Full Join      | Returns all rows from left and right tables; Nulls returned for no matching values
Cross Join     | Cartesian product of two tables where each row from the first table is paried with every row from the second 
Self Join      | Regular inner join where table is joined with itself with aliases; Useful for comparing rows within the same table

Subqquery

Allows complex filtering, aggregation, and data manipulation by using the result of one query inside another
Clauses that can be used with subqueries are:
    WHERE: filter rows based on subquery results.
    FROM: treat subquery as a temporary (derived) table.
    HAVING: filter aggregated results after grouping.


ENUM (enumeration) -- Data type used in MySQL and PostgreSQL used to define a column that can only hold a specific, predefined set of string values

Common Table Expression (CTE)

Temporary, named result set defined within execution scope of a single SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, or DELETE statement
    * Acts as a temporary view that exists only during the query
    * Enables recursive operations for hierarchical data -- References itself and executes until the full hierarchy is returned
            * Anchor member -- Initial query that selects the base case
            * Recursive member -- Query that references the CTE itself, pullling the next level of data

                        Can be referenced multiple times  |   Typically used once.
                Improves readability for complex queries  |	  Can become difficult to read when nested.
                       Optimized for multiple references  |	  May be less efficient for repeated operations.

Stored Procedure

Precompiled SQL statements stored in the database to perform a specific task
    * Can be executed as a single unit
    * Allow encapsulation of SQL code and business logic
    * Upon execution, accepts input parameters and return output 
    * Invoked by users, applications, or other procedures
    * Example
            * Automate database tasks
            * Improve efficiency
            * Reduce redundancy
